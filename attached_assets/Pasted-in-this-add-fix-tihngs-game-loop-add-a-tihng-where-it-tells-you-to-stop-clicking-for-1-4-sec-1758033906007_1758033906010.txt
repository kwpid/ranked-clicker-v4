in this, add / fix tihngs:

game loop:
- add a tihng where it tells you to stop clicking for 1-4 seconds, then itgoes back to normal, if player or ai clicks during this they lose points
- fix ai cps, higher mmr (1200+) = higher cps, and ai will typically match ur pace, either slower or faster

titles:
- titles dont show how i wnat. they should show just as text underneath the usernames on the game screen
- background of team boxes (where usernames are) should be grey, just having the team color as the outline
- title ccss / effects arent shown in game (glow / text oclor)
not title based, but instead of "You" on the title screen, show the players username, just hightlight them
